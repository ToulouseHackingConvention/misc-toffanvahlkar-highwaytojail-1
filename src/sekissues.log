04:45 < severus> Hi!
04:45 < Guest45060> Hi, new on the server ?
04:45 < severus> Yeah, just wanted a bit of help with smthg.
04:46 < Guest45060> I will need more than that to help you XD
04:47 < severus> I want to protect some important documents I found some time ago, what do I have to do to secure my system?
04:47 < Guest45060> Ouch quite a question!
04:47 < Guest45060> do you have a firewall?
04:47 < severus> Nope but I think my box does that for me. I only allowed incoming SSH connexion
04:48 < Guest45060> On port 22?
04:48 < severus> Probably I didn't touch the configuration.
04:48 < Guest45060> Thus you probably don't allow root connection. Is your user easy to guess?
04:49 < severus> Yeah ;-)
04:51 < Guest45060> Ok and is your passzword secure?
04:51 < severus> ... :-/
04:51 < Guest45060> I hope it's not foo, toto, plop, password or sthg like that :D
04:51 < severus> Almost :D OK I will have to change it I guess.
04:55 < Guest45060> One last piece of advice, never trust anyone on the web :-P
04:55 < Guest45060> pwned you, noob :D
